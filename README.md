## Introduction

In the modern retail landscape, understanding sales patterns and recommending products effectively can be a game-changer. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that delve into sales prediction models and recommendation systems to provide actionable insights.

## Features

- **Sales Prediction with XGBoost:** Utilize the power of the XGBoost algorithm to predict sales based on historical data and various influencing factors.
- **Product Recommendation:** A recommendation system that suggests products to customers based on their purchase history, preferences, and other relevant factors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: XGBoost, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn (These can be installed using pip)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/manavkdubey/sales-recommendation.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
    ```bash
    cd sales-recommendation
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
